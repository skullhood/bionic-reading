Made this project to learn how to create web browser extensions. I am not affiliated with the Bionic Reading organization or movement; just thought it would make for a fun coding exercise and learning opportunity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Build your own version

Requirements: 

* Node 16+
* Developer mode enabled on the Chrome extensions page

1. Clone this repository to a local directory using `git clone`

2. Open a terminal and install all the necessary dependencies with `npm install`

3. Build the extension using `npm run build`

4. Navigate to the Chrome "Extensions" page and click on the 'Load Unpacked' button on the top left corner of the screen. 

5. Select your build folder. You're done!


Known issues:

It should work out of the box, but adblockers and other extensions could cause trouble at first. Make sure you reload Chrome and test it out with any other extensions that could be causing trouble set to disabled. 

Happy reading!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Does nothing relevant here.

### `npm test`

Does nothing relevant here.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
